- Simulated environment maps and optimized drone trajectories using LiDAR data and SLAM algorithms.
- Pre-processed LiDAR data, including ground segmentation and elevation normalization.
- Extracted forest metrics like canopy cover, gap fraction, and leaf area index.
- Identified and segmented individual trees, calculating attributes like height and crown diameter.
