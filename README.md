- Focused on optimizing drone navigation and environmental mapping for precise forest analysis and monitoring.
- Optimized drone trajectories and simulated environment maps using LiDAR data and SLAM algorithms.
- Pre-processed LiDAR data by ground segmentation and elevation normalization to improve analysis accuracy.
- Achieved highly accurate forest metrics including canopy cover and tree attributes like height and crown diameter.
